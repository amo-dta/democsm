# Introduction to React

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. It's used for handling the view layer for web and mobile apps.

## Key Features of React

1. **Component-Based**: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
2. **Declarative**: Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.
3. **Learn Once, Write Anywhere**: Develop new features in React without rewriting existing code.

## Getting Started

To start using React, you can include it in your project using npm:

```bash
npm install react react-dom
```
