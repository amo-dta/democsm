Mobile accessibility ensures that mobile apps and websites are usable by people with disabilities. Here are some key considerations:

## Touch Target Size

Ensure touch targets are large enough (at least 44x44 pixels) for users with motor impairments.

## Gestures

Provide alternative ways to perform actions that require complex gestures.

## Screen Orientation

Support both portrait and landscape orientations.

## Color Contrast

Maintain sufficient color contrast for text and important elements.

## VoiceOver and TalkBack

Ensure your app works well with screen readers like VoiceOver (iOS) and TalkBack (Android).

## Customizable Text Size

Allow users to adjust text size without breaking the layout.

Mobile accessibility is crucial in our increasingly mobile-first world. By following these guidelines, you can make your mobile apps and websites more inclusive and user-friendly for everyone.
