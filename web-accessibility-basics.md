Web accessibility ensures that websites and web applications are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. Here are some key principles:

## 1. Perceivable

- Provide text alternatives for non-text content
- Provide captions and other alternatives for multimedia
- Create content that can be presented in different ways without losing meaning
- Make it easier for users to see and hear content

## 2. Operable

- Make all functionality available from a keyboard
- Give users enough time to read and use content
- Do not use content that causes seizures or physical reactions
- Help users navigate and find content

## 3. Understandable

- Make text readable and understandable
- Make content appear and operate in predictable ways
- Help users avoid and correct mistakes

## 4. Robust

- Maximize compatibility with current and future user tools

Remember, web accessibility benefits everyone, not just people with disabilities!
